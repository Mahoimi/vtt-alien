The injected Agent A0-3959X.91-15 begins to mutate white blood cells as they circulate throughout the body until they form a cancerous growth that becomes lodged in a vein or arterial wall.</p>\n<p>This tumor can take root in any bodily area of sufficient mass—such as the lungs, the digestive tract, the esophagus, or even the brain. Forming an amniotic sack, the tumor begins rapidly converting the host's own mutated cells into a larval Bloodburster.</p>\n<p>If lodged in a region of the body with dense muscle or bone and no easy egress, the gestating creature develops dorsal spines to aid in its escape. When the newly formed Bloodburster is ready to be born, it violently removes itself from the host— using its inordinate strength, spines, teeth, and claws to cut and tear through flesh, bone, and sinew.</p>\n<p>The process causes severe hemorrhaging and massive tissue damage in the host, is always fatal, and results in the birth of a Bloodburster.</p>\n<p>Bloodbursters have a bulbous head with sharp canines, and run about on all fours.
