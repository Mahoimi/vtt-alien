{"_id":"mKjZ8lWClZN5iwAT","name":"Act II : The Long Night","permission":{"default":0,"q8HmJQOf882klbgH":3},"folder":"","sort":100001,"flags":{},"content":"<p>Having defeated the Neomorph (or still being stalked by it), the PCs get a chance to catch their breath and start planning their way home&mdash;only to realize there are other dangers lurking about.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>PARTIAL TRUTHS (MANDATORY):</h2>\n<p>Having recovered his senses after the long hypersleep, @Compendium[world.cotg-npc.9NBdbDoWbVpSpwKV]{Johns} tells the PCs that they set down on LV-1113 and explored some ancient ruins&mdash;to which @Compendium[world.cotg-npc.VH6y9XJQ3a2aAN8u]{Clayton} quickly interjects that it was an archeological mission. Their science team collected important artifacts (the ampules in the science lab) and inadvertently brought back spores with them that infected some of the crew with @Compendium[world.neomorphs.aoJjBz6KIY7DSZTL]{Stage II Neomorphic Motes}.</p>\n<p>Johns also knows about the egg sacs and the danger they pose.</p>\n<p>The doctors on the science team came up with a cure that neutralizes the Neomorphic growth and turns it into an inert tumor. They inoculated everyone, so Johns is confused. A search of @Compendium[world.cotg-npc.656wJ8G2G6WBjB7Q]{Cooper}'s pockets reveals his still-full syringe&mdash;he never used it.</p>\n<p>If any of the PCs removed their compression suits&mdash;likely, as their air supply has probably run out by now&mdash; @Compendium[world.cotg-npc.MbvNYSO7RsyeY21V]{Flynn} suggests that they be inoculated immediately, as they have probably been infected by the @Compendium[world.neomorphs.aoJjBz6KIY7DSZTL]{Stage II Neomorphic Motes}. One PC can use Cooper&rsquo;s dose, and there are other prepared doses in the Medlab, possibly prompting a trip there to retrieve it.</p>\n<p>If they do decide to go, Dr. Flynn wants to go with them to retrieve one of the &ldquo;artifacts&rdquo; that was left there (the full ampule or one of the vials).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>BAD AIR:</h2>\n<p>Aboard the Cronus, everyone has trouble taking deep breaths&mdash;the air there is stale and heavy in carbon dioxide (see page 19).</p>\n<p>@Compendium[world.cotg-npc.9NBdbDoWbVpSpwKV]{Johns} tells them that after decades of disuse, the air scrubbers probably need their filters replaced in the central air scrubber shaft.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>T-MINUS TEN MINUTES (MANDATORY):</h2>\n<p>This event can occur in Act I if the players decide to abandon the Cronus before they find her crew, or even if they refuse to examine the ship in the first place.</p>\n<p>The PCs&rsquo; comm units crackle to life with a burst of static. It&rsquo;s Mother, contacting them directly from the Montero. &ldquo;<em>Displacement Drive malfunction</em>,&rdquo; she drones. &ldquo;<em>Cascade failure imminent. Fission reactor overload in T-minus ten minutes</em>.&rdquo; <strong>STRESS LEVEL +1</strong> for all PCs.</p>\n<p>Mother continues to remind the PCs at one-minute increments, until there are 30 seconds left, at which point she counts down to 0. This culminates with the total destruction of the Montero in a huge explosion. There is no way to stop it, although the PCs could try. You don&rsquo;t need to play this out Round by Round, but ask the players what they want to do and keep counting down at regular intervals to keep the pressure up.</p>\n<p>If they head back to the Montero and ask MU/TH/UR 6500 to stop the countdown, she refuses, even if ordered by Wilson. A successful <strong>COMTECH </strong>roll in the Montero&rsquo;s reactor control confirms that the destruction of the ship cannot be stopped, and reveals that the countdown seems to have been triggered intentionally. The truth is that MU/TH/UR 6500 has triggered the countdown herself, following Special Order 966 to ensure that the Cronus is brought back to Weyland-Yutani.</p>\n<p>The players should realize that their only chance to survive is for all to board the Cronus, and to get as far away as possible from the Montero before she detonates. If they don&rsquo;t realize this by themselves, have an NPC point it out. The engines of the Cronus are still offline, so the only way to reach safe distance is to set the Montero on a course far away from the Cronus.</p>\n<p>Either a PC must sacrifice themself, or the pilot can set the Montero on autopilot and use the ancient cargo shuttle Daisy to get back to the Cronus. Either way, have the pilot plotting the course for the Montero make a hard <strong>(&ndash;2) PILOTING</strong> roll. If it fails, the ship doesn&rsquo;t reach safe distance from the Cronus and the massive explosion causes explosive decompression in [[1d6]] compartments on the Cronus.</p>\n<p>Decide which as you see fit&mdash;you can have it happen to areas where PCs or NPCs are located, for extra drama.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>BREAKING LOOSE:</h2>\n<p>If the Cronus and the Montero are connected by the passageway umbilical, there is a problem decoupling it. As Mother&rsquo;s countdown continues, the PCs struggle to get the ships disconnected.</p>\n<p>This can be done with a cutting torch and a <strong>HEAVY MACHINERY</strong> roll, or by a <strong>STRENGTH </strong>roll. Other PCs can help. If all rolls fail, the Cronus may break loose using the power of its engines, but this causes structural damage to the ship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>NO MONEY:</h2>\n<p>During the countdown, the PCs (particularly @Compendium[world.cotg-pc.1nL6SolYpdxsQItB]{Rye} or @Compendium[world.cotg-pc.0QRoVaez237giQN1]{Miller}) might want to try to save at least part of their volatile yet valuable Tritium/Helium-3 shipment before the Montero explodes, as it&rsquo;s worth a lot of money.</p>\n<p>If Rye or Miller are NPCs, they insist on this.</p>\n<p>The cargo shuttle Daisy can carry ten tanks. Loading her with the power loader on the Montero takes time. Each tank requires a <strong>STRENGTH </strong>or <strong>HEAVY MACHINERY</strong> roll (if a power loader is used). A failed roll means a tank drops&mdash;roll [[/r 1ds]]. A roll of means that the tank explodes, destroying the Daisy and instantly killing everyone present in the Montero cargo hold.</p>\n<p>Remember to keep counting down when dramatically appropriate. If the PCs waste time, they won&rsquo;t make it into the Cronus before the Montero detonates. Anyone and anything, including the Daisy, that is caught outside the Cronus when this happens suffers blast damage. For PCs, roll for this as an explosion with <strong>Blast Power 12 </strong>[[/r 12db]]. If the Daisy is caught in the blast, she is crippled and suffers total decompression&mdash;the PCs need to escape in compression suits and abandon the cargo if they want to live. <strong>STRESS LEVEL +1 </strong>for all PCs present.</p>\n<p>On a tilt, the Daisy can be wedged into the vehicle bay of the Cronus, but both her control cab and thrusters will scrape the bay walls and ceiling on the way in. Have the pilot make a <strong>PILOTING </strong>roll. If it fails, roll [[/r 1ds]] for each tank on the Daisy. Any rolled means a tank explodes, triggering a chain reaction that destroys the Daisy and kills anyone inside the cargo lifter.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>CHANGE OF PLANS (MANDATORY):</h2>\n<p>Once the PCs realize that the Cronus is their only way home, they need to fix her comm arrays, repair her engines, and get her air scrubbers running. @Compendium[world.cotg-npc.9NBdbDoWbVpSpwKV]{Johns} or someone else from the Cronus crew can inform them about this.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>COMM ARRAY:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Repairing this requires a spacewalk, four Turns of work, and a <strong>COMTECH </strong>roll. Only one PC rolls, but others can help (including NPCs). A @Compendium[world.abominations.MsDslIE6Yv7WHrmT]{Stage IV Abomination \"Beluga-Head\"} is hibernating on the outer hull.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ENGINES:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Getting the engines back online requires external repairs (a spacewalk, three Turns of work and a HEAVY MACHINERY roll), but also requires cleaning up the reactor control room, where an @Compendium[world.abominations.MsDslIE6Yv7WHrmT]{Stage IV Abomination \"Beluga-Head\"} hibernates (see page 25).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AIR SCRUBBERS:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See page 18.</p>\n<p>During the repairs, you can spring other events on the players. For example, Cronus crew members can attack a PC during a spacewalk (see below).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>AGGRESSIVE TENDENCIES (MANDATORY):</h2>\n<p>Without warning, crew members from the Cronus start acting irrationally and aggressively, attacking the PCs in a violent rage. They have been infected by their inoculations. The derivative of the black liquid called 26 Draconis Strain transforms them into @Compendium[world.abominations.C7aHeFis3ojINgAc]{Stage II Abominations} (see page 43).</p>\n<p>Use these attacks for maximum dramatic effect. First only one NPC turns, attacking a PC in a violent rage without regard for their own survival and with no warning. The attacker cannot be reasoned with. Any attacked PC must make an <strong>immediate Panic Roll</strong>. Once the first attack is over, one or two more NPCs turn. They can attack head-on or just disappear and start stalking the PCs, returning later as fully developed @Compendium[world.abominations.ipN72INSjrMUTodF]{Stage III Abominations}. Don&rsquo;t have @Compendium[world.cotg-npc.VH6y9XJQ3a2aAN8u]{Clayton} turn early, however, as she has a role to play in Act III.</p>\n<p>If the PCs examine the bodies of the turned NPCs, they see the changes brought on by the black liquid. Remaining Cronus crew members panic, not understanding what is happening to their friends.</p>\n<p>A Scientist can ANALYZE the bodies to learn more about the transformation, but not the cause of it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>ENCOUNTERING AVA:</h2>\n<p>In a room or corridor on the Cronus, the PCs encounter the damaged android @Compendium[world.cotg-npc.ercGyVHUtetWrSlj]{Ava 6}. As the PCs round a corner, they notice a silhouetted body slumped against the far wall.</p>\n<p>This body is different than the other corpses they&rsquo;ve seen aboard. Unlike the ravaged, decayed, or skeletal remains of the others, this woman is whole. If anyone tries to lift her up, they find the back of her head slick and sticky. Expecting to pull their hand away and find it covered in blood, they instead find a milky-white substance&mdash;android blood.</p>\n<p>It is @Compendium[world.cotg-npc.ercGyVHUtetWrSlj]{Ava 6}, the ship&rsquo;s damaged and confused synthetic. She has a nasty head wound under her hair behind her right ear that can be repaired (see page 77 of the rulebook).</p>\n<p>Once repaired, Ava offers the PCs help and information. Also, Neomorphs and Abominations are confused by androids as they smell &ldquo;off&rdquo; to them&mdash;if the PCs repair her and gain her trust, they can use the creatures&rsquo; disregard for her to their advantage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>INFECTED:</h2>\n<p>If any of the PCs took the inoculation, some of them start to turn into Abominations just like the Cronus crew. First, choose one PC and describe how their skin starts to itch and their head hurts as they enter Stage I of the transformation.</p>\n<p><strong>STRESS LEVEL +1</strong> for each infected PC. Of course, Lucas can&rsquo;t be infected. Also avoid infecting Wilson early, as he has a key role to play in Act III.</p>\n<p>Shortly after, the infected PC enters @Compendium[world.abominations.C7aHeFis3ojINgAc]{Stage II} and is overcome by violent rage. (You can give the player a chance to resist the infection with a <strong>Sickness Roll against Virulence 6 </strong>[[/r 6db]] if you want to play nice.)</p>\n<p>At this point, the player gets a new Personal Agenda that overrides their current one&mdash;give the player the &ldquo;Infected Agenda&rdquo; card along with the card entitled &ldquo;Effects of Infection.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Let the player continue controlling the PC until their initial attack is resolved. Any PC attacked by another crew member must make an immediate Panic Roll.</p>\n<p>If the infected PC survives its first attack, they become an NPC under your control. The character starts stalking the other PCs and soon turns into a @Compendium[world.abominations.ipN72INSjrMUTodF]{Stage III Abomination \"Revenant\"} (and later @Compendium[world.abominations.MsDslIE6Yv7WHrmT]{Stage IV Abomination \"Beluga-Head\"}). Give the player a new character to play as a PC&mdash;it can be @Compendium[world.cotg-npc.ercGyVHUtetWrSlj]{Ava 6} or any survivors from the Cronus crew.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>YOU CAN&rsquo;T HANDLE THE TRUTH:</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[world.cotg-npc.ercGyVHUtetWrSlj]{Ava 6} tells the PCs the truth about the inoculations, if they haven&rsquo;t already figured it out.</p>\n<p>Anyone who has been administered the cure could turn into an Abomination&mdash;but they have a chance to resist. She also reveals the presence of Agent A0-3959X.91&ndash;15, which is on board.</p>\n<p>The rare &ldquo;artifacts&rdquo; that Clayton wants taken back are actually deadly weapons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}
