Deciphering part of the data transmission led them to the 26 Draconis system and a small planetoid dubbed LV-1113 tucked away in the planetary debris belt shared by the suns of this trinary star system.</p>\n<p>The chemical was discovered there, but some of it had been previously deployed, causing mutations in the planet&rsquo;s lifeforms.</p>\n<p>While the science team modified and experimented with what they called the 26 Draconis strain of the black liquid, members of the crew became infected with Mote pathogen spores, causing them to give birth to Bloodbursters which quickly matured into Neomorphs.</p>\n<p>Chaos soon broke out. There was a mutiny, the science module on the Cronus was ejected and left behind, and the surviving crew escaped the planetoid.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The 26 Draconis Strain</h2>\n<p>Discovering that some among them had been infected by the spores before departing, the remaining scientists used a derivative of the 26 Draconis strain to inoculate the crew against the Neomorph spores.</p>\n<p>The doctors administering it were unaware that their cure was not completely safe, however&mdash;nor that it could cause those inoculated to mutate into Abominations. As some of the inoculated began to transform and others didn&rsquo;t, the crew of the Cronus failed to make the correlation.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, as the ship was overrun with Neomorphs and Abominations, they realized they were in over their heads. Barricading themselves on cryodeck and leaving the ship&rsquo;s synthetic&mdash;Ava&mdash;to maintain the infested ship, they put themselves in stasis and hoped for a miracle.</p>\n<p>After being caught in a micro-meteorite storm, navigation control failed on the Cronus and her comms array was damaged. Ava was attacked by the Abominations while attempting to repair the engines. Life support failed, plunging the ship into a deep cold. The crew remained safe in their hypersleep chambers, and the creatures aboard went into a state of suspended animation.</p>\n<p>This all happened within two days of leaving LV-1113. Since then, the Cronus has been adrift, barreling along at sublight speeds for decades.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Mother's Note</h2>\n<p>The 26 Draconis Strain inoculation works&mdash;95% of the time it does indeed arrest the development of any Neomorph spores deposited by the Motes.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is also a significant risk of the black liquid derivative going too far and recoding the DNA of the inoculated, slowly transforming them into zombie-like Abominations (see page 38).</p>"}

As they attempt to transfer the survivors to the Montero, the starfreighter&rsquo;s reactor is set to overload by one of the crew, who has orders to bring back the xeno morphic materials the Cronus is carrying.</p>\n<p>With their ship destroyed, the Montero crew is forced to repair the Cronus instead.</p>\n<p>The crew soon finds themselves caught between corporate agents who put their mission and a paycheck ahead of human lives, the crew of the Cronus who are suffering from an infection that is slowly turning them into monsters, feral alien creatures that are out for blood, and a murderous android who wants to stop Weyland-Yutani from getting their hands on anything alien.</p>\n<p>Just when the Montero crew discover that they too might be infected, pirates attempt to seize the ship.</p>\n<p>It all comes down to one question&mdash;does the crew want to stop a dangerous biological weapon from getting into the wrong hands, or do they want to become very, very rich?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>What the hell happened to the Cronus ?</h1>\n<p>Acting on classified data from an encrypted transmission, the Cronus was launched in 2110 to attempt to locate samples of Chemical Agent A0-3959X.91&ndash;15. Deciphering part of the data transmission led them to the 26 Draconis system and a small planetoid dubbed LV-1113 tucked away in the planetary debris belt shared by the suns of this trinary star system.</p>\n<p>The chemical was discovered there, but some of it had been previously deployed, causing mutations in the planet&rsquo;s lifeforms.</p>\n<p>While the science team modified and experimented with what they called the 26 Draconis strain of the black liquid, members of the crew became infected with Mote pathogen spores, causing them to give birth to Bloodbursters which quickly matured into Neomorphs.</p>\n<p>Chaos soon broke out. There was a mutiny, the science module on the Cronus was ejected and left behind, and the surviving crew escaped the planetoid.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The 26 Draconis Strain</h2>\n<p>Discovering that some among them had been infected by the spores before departing, the remaining scientists used a derivative of the 26 Draconis strain to inoculate the crew against the Neomorph spores.</p>\n<p>The doctors administering it were unaware that their cure was not completely safe, however&mdash;nor that it could cause those inoculated to mutate into Abominations. As some of the inoculated began to transform and others didn&rsquo;t, the crew of the Cronus failed to make the correlation.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, as the ship was overrun with Neomorphs and Abominations, they realized they were in over their heads. Barricading themselves on cryodeck and leaving the ship&rsquo;s synthetic&mdash;Ava&mdash;to maintain the infested ship, they put themselves in stasis and hoped for a miracle.</p>\n<p>After being caught in a micro-meteorite storm, navigation control failed on the Cronus and her comms array was damaged. Ava was attacked by the Abominations while attempting to repair the engines. Life support failed, plunging the ship into a deep cold. The crew remained safe in their hypersleep chambers, and the creatures aboard went into a state of suspended animation.</p>\n<p>This all happened within two days of leaving LV-1113. Since then, the Cronus has been adrift, barreling along at sublight speeds for decades.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Mother's Note</h2>\n<p>The 26 Draconis Strain inoculation works&mdash;95% of the time it does indeed arrest the development of any Neomorph spores deposited by the Motes.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is also a significant risk of the black liquid derivative going too far and recoding the DNA of the inoculated, slowly transforming them into zombie-like Abominations (see page 38).</p>"}

The most important distinction is that the Montero has standard Saturn J 3000 engines, instead of the Rolls-Royce N66 Cyclone upgrades that the Nostromo had. As such, she is not rated as a commercial tug. She is fitted to haul cargo internally like a standard freighter, and has a cavernous bay with ventral access.</p>\n<p>This scenario starts off on the Montero, and an overview of the main personnel deck can be seen to the right. The rest of the ship is not mapped out in detail, as it is unlikely that the PCs will spend much time here&mdash;see Events.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Cargo</h2>\n<p>The Montero&rsquo;s bay is currently full of 72 high-pressure tanks carrying 200,000 tons of aging yet still highly flammable Tritium. The volatile nature of Tritium means that it can be a bitch to transport, but by the time this shipment reaches port it will have completed radioactive decay into Helium-3&mdash;a safe and clean energy source used throughout the colonies.</p>\n<p>Each tank is half the size of a tanker trailer. When the adventure begins, about half of the gas is still flammable. Extreme caution is advised. To ferry cargo to and from low orbit, the Montero is equipped with an ailing WY-37B Flatbed Cargo Lifter called Daisy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Passageway Umbilical</h2>\n<p>The Montero is equipped with a 10-meter-long passageway umbilical, which can be used to connect to the airlocks of other spacecraft and thus allow passage without the need for a spacewalk.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Gear on the Montero</h1>\n<p>The following pieces of gear are available on the Montero at the start of the scenario. The PCs&mdash;or rather, Captain Miller&mdash;must decide on how best to distribute the gear. Details on this gear can be found in Chapter 5.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>5 x @Item[VvzxKsZa2s4wJ9Tm]{IRC MK.50 Compression Suit} (starting Air Supply 5 in each)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1 x M314 Motion Tracker (Power Supply 5)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1 x @Item[uTjIXYc3aha49LsP]{Cutting Torch} (Power Supply 5)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1 x @Item[b8oNVaijglYL1YsN]{Watatsumi DV-303 Bolt Gun} (4 shots)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1 x @Item[X1WYPjmvgGUw07PD]{M4A3 Pistol} (1 reload)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1 x @Item[66Ve45qeL2iBRZmr]{SpaceSub ASSO-400 Harpoon Grappling Gun}</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1 x @Item[GjTbKf0Ym5yewsoe]{M240 Incinerator Unit} (2 reloads)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>1 x @Item[EXyYJiuCB7QSNvPn]{Caterpillar P-5000 Powered Work Loader}</p>\n</li>\n</ul>"}
